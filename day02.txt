Dig. Dig. Dig. It felt like they'd done nothing but dig for weeks now. The loose, loamy soil had given way to thicker, denser mud, and still they dug. Kow was adamant though; the dig had to continue. They had to empty it, to open it. 

They'd found it months ago. Who'd have thought that someone striking rock while tilling a field would have turned their lives upside-down. The day-to-day routine was nothing more than a memory now. Everything revolved around it. The rock. The head. There was no reason for a stone head to be lying in the ground, and certainly no reason for it to be a stone head of this size. They uncovered the eye sockets first, each the size of a field. The mouth though, the mouth was huge. Utterly vast.  Elder Kow decided on everything, and Kow had a determination as firm as the rock of the head itself. "We open the mouth. We must hear it speak".

Today, they broke through. Today the mouth was opened. The world trembled, and then it all came out. A god heaved and everything changed.
