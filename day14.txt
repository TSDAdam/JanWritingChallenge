They came stumbling out of the cave into the blinding light of the day. It was a nice day, but there was no message. For as many days as they could remember, they would come out from their slumber and look at the flat rock, whereupon the words of TIM would have appeared magically overnight.

Nobody knew who TIM was, what he looked like, or where he came from. Come what may, though, TIM's words would be etched in the stone for all to see. 

TIM's words dictated how his followers live their lives. Each day was a pensive ball of excitement with a dense core of foreboding, for they knew not which words would be presented to them each day. They didn't know what his utterances would be, or which tale they might recant. All they knew was that TIM's words dictated how they lived, but today TIM's words were absent.

The ape-like creatures scratched their heads and looked at one another with vacant eyes, unsure what to do next. Maybe just go back into the cave, and see what the next brings.
