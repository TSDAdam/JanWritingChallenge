We went to Marks & Spencer today to pick up some clothes that she'd ordered. A cold and grey drive on a Sunday, just the sort of drive I really dislike. Too drizzly for the intermittent wipers, not rainy enough for the normal ones. Impatient morons driving like idiots, convinced that the three seconds they saved getting to the roundabout was worth the potential vehicular fatality.

I had a look at the sale rail while she tried on her things, and once again my brain was broken by the choice. If I'm confronted by too many things to choose from, I can't do it. I get more and more stressed by the situation, and something that could have been easy, and should have been nice is ruined. I once spent an hour in TK Maxx trying to buy a frying pan. I left feeling like I'd been asked to do the trolley problem in real life, sans frying pan.

I came home with a sore back, no new clothes, and a growing dislike of selfish drivers in Discoverys. The spellchecker in neovim doesn't like the way I've pluralised 'Discovery', but I'm okay with that.
