The Weird

I live in Cornwall, on the tippy-toe of the UK. This county is famed for its mining heritage, but mining (for the time being) is dead. It leaves a sprawling rabbit warren of abandoned tunnels beneath the granite. It weirds me out to think about those tunnels and adits now. The mineshafts and tunnels, once bustling with noise and industry, now silent and empty.

Miles and miles of holes carved through the bedrock, twisting this way and that, like woodworm in an old piece of furniture. The miners used to talk about the various spirits and supernatural creatures who lived in the mines, and you can understand where that must have come from. Noises coming from deep, dark tunnels, the sources unseen. It's no wonder they developed superstitions about The Knockers, and no wonder they used to surrender the (objectively best bit) bottom corner of their pasties to keep them happy. 

To think of generations that came before me, toiling in what must have seemed like an alien world beneath them. When I imagine being the first people walking down a shaft, pitch black nothingness ahead of them, eerie noises echoing towards them - I can't comprehend how terrifying it must have been. In my mind it's akin to Captain Dallas in the shafts in Alien (1979). Cramped, dark, unseen dangers.
