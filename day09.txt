Introductions

He worked hard his whole life up to this point, and it was only about to get harder. Some people didn't want to take up traditional maintenance jobs, but he was different. The life of lying on his back, dirty water dripping on his face, wrench in hand, fixing people's plumbing. A hard-working, industrious fellow. 

He was short of stature, shorter even than his only brother, who stood head and shoulders taller. His diminutive stature, combined with his ample waistline, would cause a lot of people to refer to him as jolly. In fairness, he was a happy soul. Nothing seemed to phase him, nothing stopped the edges of his bushy, black moustache curling up to the corners of his eyes when he smiled.

Life was different now. Very different. His almost unbelievable levels of fitness were going to be a major boon in this crazy, alien world. His bright attire matched his sunny disposition, but it would all get tested in his Sisyphus-like trials. No matter how many times he thought he had succeeded. No matter how many of the bad guys fell under his feet. No matter what he did, his ordeal never seemed to end. 

Mario had a hard life.
