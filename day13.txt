One Syllable

Spring is here and my thoughts turn to life. Life out of doors. My lawns, my trees, my fruits and my pond. I count myself as lucky as I have a lot of space, but it needs a lot of care. The grass grows and grows, and soon I will have to mow it. I mow once a week, and that sorts it out well. The trees took big hits in the storm last week, so there is a lot of wood on the ground, wood that I have to shred. I love to shred though. It feels so good when a dry branch goes through it like a hot knife through butter.

The pond is green and needs a clean (to make this rhyme, I did not mean), but I don't have fish, so it's not first on the list. It still needs to be done though. The fruit trees are where my heart lies. I have pear, fig, apple and more, and I love to watch them bloom - and to eat the fruit come fall time. I spend a lot of time out there. I can sit and read, and thanks to today's tech I can write and code out there too. I feed the birds, play with my dogs, and at the end of a long day of work I can chill in the hot tub too. I might even take a beer in with me. Life is good.
