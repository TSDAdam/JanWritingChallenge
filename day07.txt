Gift

I've had this colander for maybe 10 or 15 years now. It's bright orange and made of plastic. Tough, rigid plastic of some kind. I'm not sure what kind it is, but it's survived many drops, bashes and countless dishwasher sessions.  The plastic is very finely textured. It's a similar texture to most computer mouses, but when the mouse was new. Not those shiny patches where your fingers rest for hours on end. 

As far as colanders go, I think it's pretty interesting. Its shape, for a start, is irregular. Imagine a square with rounded corners, but for most of one corner the shape is cut across at 45 degrees, where its holey body morphs into a handle. Many colanders are round, which tend to fit into utensils like saucepans nicely, whereas this one tends to not feel quite right. Like using the wrong screw when you're putting flatpack furniture together. 

It's great though, I love this colander. Not only does it strain the water from pasta and vegetables like an absolute boss, but it also doubles as a fantastic 'bits bowl' cup for board game tokens. "Oh you want the thing full of meeples for your turn of Paladins of the West Kingdom? No problem, grab the colander by this super-helpful handle!"
