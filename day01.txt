Imperfection
------------
My intolerance of my own imperfections is the bane of everything I try to do. I've learned to look to my son as an example of what I should be doing. If he's making a drawing and it doesn't go perfectly, he doesn't mind. He just carries on. If he's putting a Gunpla together, he doesn't spend ages making sure every burr is removed, or that every join is airtight. "It's fine, dad!". I need to learn to not necessarily _embrace_ imperfection, but to at least let it go and be happy with 'good enough'.

I know people point to things like Japanese Kintsugi (repairing broken crockery with gold) as the exemplar of embracing imperfection, but for me I think it's going to be things like picking up that guitar hanging on the wall near me and accepting that I won't get it right for ages, but doing it anyway. Or taking some of those online Japanese conversation classes and knowing I'll sound like a lemon and trip over my tongue repeatedly, but persisting. My brain doesn't like imperfections, and it needs some rewiring. Time to be happy enough with messy rewiring and see where it takes me.
