Repair

Paul Parr's pears were pears par exellence. His pears pulled paralegals, padres and au pairs alike from parts all around. Presently, Paul had a problem. Paul's pussycat, Peter, had been playing post-work, pounced on a plaything, and pinged it. It was propelled at a perilous pace into Paul's pear products. A pair of pears had plummeted from the shelves of Parr's Pear Pantry. They were broken and in need of repair.

You see, Paul's pears weren't the pears you picked to eat. They weren't palatable pears for purchase, plating and pecking at. No, Paul Parr's pears were for prettification, they were pendants. This pair though, this plucky pair of pears, pared from planks of pearwood, had been punished. 

He worked quickly, prior to his pantry opening and proffering prime patrons into his parlor. The pearwood part of these pear-shaped pair of pendants had pried proud of their pewter platforms. He took premium prongs of pearwood and replaced the poorly parts, restoring them to their previous prime. Paul Parr's pair of pear repairs repaired the pearwood parts, and he smiled to himself to know the pair had been re-peared.
