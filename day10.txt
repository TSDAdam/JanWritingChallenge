Last year I had to have a hernia repaired. It might not seem like a big deal if you've ever been under the knife before, but to me it was all-consuming. I'd never had an operation before, and I was terrified.

Normally I like to think of myself as a logical person. Someone who doesn't believe in the supernatural, someone who can think with reason. When it came close to the day of the operation, though, I was a mess. The days leading up to it filled my brain with lasts. Maybe this is the last time I sit in the hot tub. Maybe this is the last time I drive the car. Maybe this is the last time I go to Tesco. Tick, tick, tick. 

No joke. As I walked out of Tesco with my shopping, I took a wistful look over my shoulder back into the shop, the same shop I usually can't wait to be out of, and had a thought like "farewell, old friend". On the morning of the day, I didn't voice it, but I said a potential goodbye to my dogs as I left under the cover of darkness. I finished charging my phone for the final time. My mind was doing its level best to tick off its own checklist of "Things you'll never do again", as if it was checking items off its packing list before sending me off on holiday to somewhere beyond the grave. When you're afraid, everything is a metaphor.
