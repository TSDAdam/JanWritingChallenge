Transformation

Tim added the prompt to the channel and I clicked. I clicked and I read.  I never know what each day's prompt will bring, it's been a bit like opened a belated Advent Calendar, which is fun.

As with each day, I start by trying to choose what sort of _thing_ I want to write. Something fictional? A short editorial piece pried from my memories or experiences maybe? Today, nothing was forthcoming. Nothing felt right. I thought about trying to come up with a poem, but there were two big problems. First, and foremost, I'm terrible at poetry. Secondly, and more irking to me was the feeling that echoing a poem with another, but worse poem felt trite and obvious. Does being obvious matter? Probably not.

I didn't know where I was going with this.

I sat, munching on my peanut butter on wholemeal toast, awaiting the start of my next meeting, and felt my mind catch on something, like finding the plug chain in the bath when it catches between your toes. A couple of years ago when I was doing Tim's 100 Day Writing Challenge, some days had us writing a stream of consciousness, so I chose to do that. Although oddly, as I sit here writing, I realise it feels more like recanting a tale, and less like writing as the words come tumbling out. How odd.
