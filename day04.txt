Marginalia

Pull the tip of the middle finger back during spear hand to make flat edge - no cutting off fingertips!
The source of the will is in the waist - twist and lock, finish each movement.
Forearm aligned with first two knuckles, straight line, impact through knuckles only.
Big toe pulled back for knife edge foot for yup chagi - penetrate.
80-20 weight distribution for back stance. Hip back, back straight.
Remember! on turns at the end of hyungs, rotate past the horizontal. Front foot steps to left of centre line, lock that stance in and have a wide stance.

Keep your eyes up and looking at that imaginary point in the distance. Do not look at your feet. Remember that EVERY turn leads with the head. Look first, and then move. Move with confidence and don't let messing up fluster you. You're meant to break. You're meant to make mistakes. All that matters is how you cope with it. The physical is designed to break you down before you start. When you feel like you can't get your breath, take big bellyfuls of air and hold. It will come back. Don't worry about the break, you'll go through it like butter. Good luck, and Tang Soo!
